# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

Actually, this one isn't my first application on RoR but author of tutorial (link's attached) asked me to follow its instructions strictly, so I do.

 If somebody is really going to attest my work here, just be sure about tests they're smth new for me.
 Soon I'm going to make work, not fun.
